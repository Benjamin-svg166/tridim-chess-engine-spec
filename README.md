Clean-room specification for a tridimensional chess engine
Perfect, Benjamin ‚Äî here‚Äôs a clean, developer-friendly **Markdown version** of your clean-room tridimensional chess engine spec. You can copy and paste this directly into your GitHub repository as your `README.md` or `spec.md` file.

# üß† Tridimensional Chess Engine Spec (Clean-Room Draft v1.0)

## üéØ Purpose and Vision
To create a modular, extensible chess engine capable of simulating, evaluating, and playing tridimensional chess across floating boards and layered tactics. The engine will support immersive visualization, AI opponent logic, and training modules for strategic cognition.

---

## üß© Core Components

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Board Manager** | Handles creation and manipulation of 3D boards (e.g., 3 layers √ó 8√ó8 grids). Supports floating boards, layer transitions, and piece placement. |
| **Piece Logic Engine** | Encodes movement rules for all pieces across layers. Includes vertical transitions, layer-specific constraints, and special moves (e.g., Layered Castling, Floating En Passant). |
| **Game State Tracker** | Maintains turn order, move history, captured pieces, and win conditions. Supports undo/redo and alternate line simulation. |
| **AI Evaluator** | Implements evaluation logic for position scoring, tactical motifs, and layered threats. Can be rule-based or integrate with external engines. |
| **UI/Visualization Layer** | Renders the board in 3D or layered 2D. Supports immersive overlays, piece highlighting, and move previews. |
| **Training Module** | Allows creation of drills, puzzles, and Layered Zugzwang setups. Supports user-defined scenarios and tactical themes. |

## ‚ôüÔ∏è Piece Movement Rules (Sample)

| Piece | Movement Across Layers |
|-------|------------------------|
| **Knight** | Jumps in L-shapes across layers (e.g., 2 squares on one layer, 1 on another). |
| **Rook** | Moves linearly across rows, columns, and vertical layers. |
| **Bishop** | Diagonal movement across layers (e.g., NW to SE across boards). |
| **Queen** | Combines rook and bishop logic across all layers. |
| **King** | One square in any direction, including vertical. Supports Layered Castling. |
| **Pawn** | Advances forward on its layer; can ascend/descend under specific conditions. Supports Floating En Passant. |

## üîê Legal and Clean-Room Principles

- No reference to existing copyrighted code.
- All logic is derived from public domain rules or original design.
- Developers must build from this spec without copying any existing tridimensional chess software.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Notes

- **Language-agnostic**: Can be implemented in Java, Python, C++, etc.
- **Modular design**: Each component should be independently testable.
- **Extensible**: Support future variants (e.g., 4-layer boards, AI training modes).
- **Open architecture**: Encourage community contributions and alternate rule sets.

---

## üöÄ Future Expansion Ideas

- Adaptive AI that learns layered tactics.
- Multiplayer support with synchronized overlays.
- Integration with immersive VR or AR platforms.
- Developer API for puzzle creation and game simulation.

## üìú Author Notes

This spec was drafted by Benjamin Nathaniel Bussie as part of a clean-room initiative to advance the future of tridimensional chess cognition and platform design. It is intended for open collaboration and ethical innovation.
